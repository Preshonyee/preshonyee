### Hi, I’m Presh! Nice to meet you! 👋🏾
(he/him)

I'm a designer and engineer focused on UI engineering and design systems. I build for the web and mobile(occasionally) platforms. A lot of my work focuses on helping designers and engineers work more efficiently together.

I'm currently building [Camara](https://www.camara.space), a design system with reusable UI components library and APIs for the best default user, designer and developer experience.

Building beautiful, accessible, responsive and performant interfaces are things I advocate for and love to nerd about.
