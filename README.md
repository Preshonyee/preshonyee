### Talk to me about all things 'Design Systems'

I'm **Presh** - designer and engineer focused on UI engineering and design systems. I build for web and iOS. A lot of my work focuses on helping designers and engineers work more efficiently together.

I'm currently building [Camara](https://www.camara.space), a design system with reusable UI components library and APIs for the best default user, designer and developer experience.

Building beautiful, accessible, responsive and performant interfaces are things I advocate for and love to nerd about.
